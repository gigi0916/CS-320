Gianna Screen - SNHU Final Project

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, it is extremely important to prioritize maintaining quality that is not only efficient and secure but also consistent throughout. Cutting corners can create gaps in the user experience and, more importantly, introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Inconsistent code quality also leads to long-term maintenance issues where bugs become increasingly difficult to trace and fix.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, I focus on fully understanding the defined software requirements. For this project, the requirements were consistent and clearly outlined, which allowed me to ensure step by step that my program and overall approach met each one. I used the provided rubric as a checklist to verify that every feature and function supported the intended user needs.

How do I approach designing software?
- When approaching software design, I start by getting a firm understanding of the requirements and the needs of the end users. I make sure that every part of the program has a defined purpose and aligns with the overall goals before I begin writing any code. Planning ahead helps me visualize how each component should interact, which rehelps mitigate and reduceduces errors.
